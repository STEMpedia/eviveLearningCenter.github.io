    <h1><strong>Tactile Switches</strong></h1>
<p>The two tactile switches are connected to Arduino pins 38 and 39, both active high. This means that the pins are at +5V when the switch is pressed, and at 0V (Ground) otherwise.</p>

<div class="doc-note"> Note that pins 38, 39 are pulled low, i.e. they will be at 0V (and not floating) when the switch is not pressed</div>
<p>The test code for the tactile switch is given below:</p>

/*
 evive inbuilt pushbutton code

 Pushbutton 1 is connected to digital pin 38.
 Pushbutton 2 is connected to digital pin 39.
 
 This code demonstrates how to use evive inbuilt tactile switches.
 The code turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital
 pin 13, when pressing a pushbutton.

// set pin numbers:
int buttonPin = 38;     // the number of the pushbutton 1 pin
//int buttonPin = 39;     // the number of the pushbutton 2 pin

// Note: This code is meant to run for only one pushbutton. Please initialise only one of the pushbutton.

int ledPin =  13;      // the number of the LED pin

int buttonState = 0;         // variable for reading the pushbutton status

void setup() {
  // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
  // open serial port, set data rate at 9600 bps:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  // check if the pushbutton is pressed.
  // if it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    // print on serial monitor
    Serial.println("Pushbotton is Pressed");
    delay(100);
    // turn LED on:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  } else {
    // turn LED off:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
