		<h1><strong>Serial Pins</strong></h1>
<p>Serial communication is the process of sending data one bit at a time, sequentially, over a communication channel or computer bus.</p>
<p>For evive, serial pins are used for communication between evive and a computer or sensors or any other devices. It has three serial ports available: Serial0 on pins 0 (RX0) and 1 (TX0), Serial2 on pins 17 (RX2) and 16 (TX2), and Serial3 on pins 15 (RX3) and 14 (TX3).</p>

<p>While communicating with the computer or for uploading Arduino sketch, evive uses serial port 0 via USB. Thus, if you use these functions, you cannot also use pins 0 and 1 for digital input or output. Communication with HC05 (Bluetooth), ESP-12e (or 12f) ESP8266 (WiFi) or Xbee is done via serial port 3. Do not use digital pins 14 and 15 while using any of the three device.</p>
<p>Note: Arduino MEGA has Serial port 1 on pins 19 (RX1) and 18 (TX1), but in evive, pin 19 is used for <a href="http://learn.evive.cc/index.html?t=NavKey" style="color: #1c75bc" >Navigation Key/Joystick</a>, so we cannot use Serial port 1.</p>
