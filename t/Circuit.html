<p>Fritzing circuits is a pictorial style of circuit diagram. Conventionally people use symbols and wires to represent a component of a circuit. But for a beginner it is difficult to understand any circuit and document his work properly in the conventional way. Fritzing makes the things easy. All the component have a realistic look which makes it very easy for beginners to understand.</p>
